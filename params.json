It will check its' MongoDB mood database for reference, and will find an appropriate song to give back in its' MongoDB song database.  It will then prompt the user to input an explanation to their problem, scan through for keywords, and search for resources on the internet to return.\r\n\r\n### Features\r\n- Adorable eye-pleasing JavaFX graphics\r\n- MongoDB Java Driver\r\n- Google CustomSearch API\r\n\r\n### Technical Aspects\r\nClass diagrams here\r\n\r\n### Contributing\r\n- Issue Tracker: https://github.com/cpe305/fall2016-project-jeffclam/issues\r\n- Source Code: https://github.com/cpe305/fall2016-project-jeffclam\r\n\r\n### Support\r\nPlease contact jeffrey.clam95@gmail.com for any inquiries about this project.\r\n",
