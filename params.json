TheraPC is a program that wants to make you feel better and solve your problems.\r\n\r\n### What is TheraPC?\r\nWhat is it?\r\n>TheraPC is an individual software project that accepts your current emotion and personal problem to return a song to listen to and resources it finds helpful.\r\n\r\nHow does it do it?\r\n>TheraPC activates a program with a JavaFX GUI that prompts the user to input an emotion.  It will check its' MongoDB mood database for reference, and will find an appropriate song to give back in its' MongoDB song database.  It will then prompt the user to input an explanation to their problem, scan through for keywords, and search for resources on the internet to return.\r\n\r\n### Technical Features\r\n- Adorable eye-pleasing JavaFX graphics\r\n- MongoDB Java Driver\r\n- ElasticSearch API\r\n- Google CustomSearch API\r\n\r\n### Going through the program\r\n##### Inputting Your Mood\r\n![Initial Screen](https://github.com/cpe305/fall2016-project-jeffclam/blob/gh-pages/Images/1.PNG?raw=true) ![Inputting Emotion](https://github.com/cpe305/fall2016-project-jeffclam/blob/gh-pages/Images/2.PNG?raw=true)\r\n\r\n##### Retrieving Feedback\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n##### Accessing Resources\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### Technical Aspects\r\n##### System Architecture\r\n###### Model-View-Controller Design\r\n![System Architecture](https://github.com/cpe305/fall2016-project-jeffclam/blob/gh-pages/Images/3%20tier.PNG?raw=true)\r\n![Overall Class Diagram](https://github.com/cpe305/fall2016-project-jeffclam/blob/gh-pages/Images/Class%20Diagram.png?raw=true)\r\n\r\n##### Design Pattern\r\n###### Factory Pattern\r\nExample\r\n![Example Factory Pattern](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/design_pattern/images/factory_pattern_uml_diagram.jpg)\r\nDesign Applied\r\n![My Factory](https://github.com/cpe305/fall2016-project-jeffclam/blob/gh-pages/Images/FactoryClasses.png?raw=true)\r\n\r\n### Contributing\r\n- Issue Tracker: https://github.com/cpe305/fall2016-project-jeffclam/issues\r\n- Source Code: https://github.com/cpe305/fall2016-project-jeffclam\r\n\r\n### Support\r\nPlease contact jeffrey.clam95@gmail.com for any inquiries about this project.\r\n",
